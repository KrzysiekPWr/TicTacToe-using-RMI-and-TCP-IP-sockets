# TicTacToe-using-RMI-and-TCP-IP-sockets

This project was study-related (3rd semester). My task was to write a console-based TicTacToe game in client-server architecture using RMI for communication between clients and TCP/IP for chat functionality.

## Detailed info
*   The app is fully console-based.
*   The app runs in a client-server architecture and connection can be established only locally.
*   The communication between server and clients is based on RMI.
*   The chat functionality is based on TCP/IP sockets.
*   All game mechanics are implemented on the server side.
*   Application can handle multiple users playing at the same time.
*   You can join a particular player - there is game room functionality
*   Chat works between two players independently of the server.

## Running the application
Client must specify two run arguments:
*   name
*   room_name

Server will automatically connect two players with the same room name.
